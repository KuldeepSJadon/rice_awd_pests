Water and nitrogen management play vital roles in rice production. However, mismanagement of these two management practices may trigger plant disease epidemics such as sheath blight of rice, caused by Rhizoctonia solani, which is favoured by wet conditions, high relative humidity, and high nitrogen (N) fertiliser levels. In order to understand how different combinations of water and nitrogen management affect sheath blight epidemics, we conducted two split-plot experiments with two irrigation regimes in the dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. The irrigation treatments in both experiments were: flooded and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). In 2015 the N applications were applied in splits in both seasons as 0 kg ha-1, 120 kg ha–1, and 150 kg ha–1 total N. In 2016 changes were made between seasons to address issues that were previously discovered in 2015. In 2016 the N applications were 60 kg ha-1 and 180 kg ha-1 total N. Disease scoring was the same in both experiments, using a sheath blight assessment scale for field evaluation developed at IRRI was used to assess the severity on infected sheaths and leaves while sheath blight incidence on tillers were counted per hill. Five and four disease assessments were made in 2015 and 2016 respectively. While the changes for 2016 resulted in more robust data,w e were unable to detect any differences in disease in either experiment due to irrigation methods, N rates or the interaction of the two treatments.
