Description: Provides a research compendium of analysis associated with experiments
  conducted at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Los BaÃ±os,
  Calabarzon, Philippines in the dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. The experiments
  were designed to test the effects of alternate wetting and drying irrigation
  management on rice sheath blight disease. The plots were split plot with an
