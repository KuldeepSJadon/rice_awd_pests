Check NTShB/LShB/TShB ratings in both years, make sure that they are both reporting the same values

library(nlme)
LShB_model <- lme(LShB_rating ~ WMGT*NRTE + as.factor(YEAR), random = ~ 1|REP/WMGT, data = AUDPS)
TShB_model <- lme(TShB_rating ~ WMGT*NRTE + as.factor(YEAR), random = ~ 1|REP/WMGT, data = AUDPS)
