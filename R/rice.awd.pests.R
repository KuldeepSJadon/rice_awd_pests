#' Reproducible Research Compendium for Analysing Effects of Water Management and Nitrogen on Rice Sheath Blight and Insect Populations
#'
#' @description
#' Provides a research compendium of analysis associated with experiments
#' conducted at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Los Ba√±os,
#' Calabarzon, Philippines in the dry seasons of 2015 and 2016. The experiments
#' were designed to test the effects of alternate wetting and drying irrigation
#' management on rice sheath blight disease. The plots were split plot with an
